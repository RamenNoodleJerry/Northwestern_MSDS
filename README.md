### **MSDS422 Practical Machine Learning Project**

This course introduces several machine learning methods from simple linear regression to neural networks MLP/RNN/CNN. 

### **MSDS420 Database System**

This course introduces Relational Database and SQL query, Geodata Folium mapping, NoSQL databases like documents-based, vector-based, and graph-relational database, and their query languages like Elastic Search, and Milvus search. Finally the course also introduced prompt engineering and Informational Retrieval.

### **MSDS460 Decision Analytics**
This course introduces methods of optimization, simulation and decision analysis techniques for prescriptive analytics in business. Students explore linear programming, network optimization, integer linear programming, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, nonlinear programming, metaheuristic algorithms, stochastic simulation, queuing modeling, decision analysis, and Markov decision processes.
