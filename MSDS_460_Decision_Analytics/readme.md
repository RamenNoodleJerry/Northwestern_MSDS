## MSDS 460 – Decision Analytics

Explore linear programming, network optimization, integer linear programming, goal programming, multiple objective optimization, nonlinear programming, metaheuristic algorithms, stochastic simulation, queuing modeling, decision analysis, and Markov decision processes.

### Final Project
We solve a linear programming model to help NU Industries optimize production, inventory, distribution, labor (including overtime), raw materials, and marketing decisions across two plants and five time periods in order to maximize total profit. Using Python’s PuLP library, we analyze constraints, interpret results, and run sensitivity analyses to identify key bottlenecks and improvement opportunities in the supply chain
