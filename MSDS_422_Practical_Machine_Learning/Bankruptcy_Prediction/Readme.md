Bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999–2009

**Context**
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

Split the training set into an 80% training and 20% validation set and conduct EDA. 

Build six models trying to predict if a company will go bankruptcy eventually using features provided: 

an SVM, 

a logistic regression model, 

a Naïve Bayes model, 

a random forest, 

an XGboosted Tree, 

an Extra tree.


Conduct hyperparameter tuning and evaluate goodness of fit metrics including TPR, FPR, precision, recall, and accuracy on the training and validation sets. 
Build ROC and Precision / Recall graphs. Evaluate models' performance on the validation set using the F1-score.
