Learn computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data

“MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision.” It is a classic dataset to use for measuring and benchmarking 
classification algorithms. In this research, we will identify correct digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 

The dataset contains 700+ columns each indicating a pixel of the chart. We will apply a random forest classifier, Principal Component Analysis, K-means clustering, and MLP Neural Networks
to analyze this dataset, making predictions and identifying principal components that best explain variability.
