**Financial Time Series**

Financial time series is an obvious area for the use of RNN, as the sequence is more important than the individual observations. 
By building models to forecast indices, We learn how to employ them in time series modeling. 

We will Webscrap 5 years of daily adjusted closing prices for the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 index from finance.yahoo.com. 
Build RNN LSTM models with the first 80% of the data and forecast the last 20%.
